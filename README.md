cpp

#include "ATM.h"


int main() {
    ATM atm;
    atm.start();
    return 0;
}
Usage

Compilation: Compile using a C++ compiler.



g++ main.cpp ATM.cpp Customer.cpp -o atm


Execution: Run the compiled program.


./atm
Interaction: Authenticate and perform transactions through the menu.


Summary

The ATM class handles user interactions and transactions, while the Customer class represents bank customers with methods for authentication and balance management. Together, they create a functional ATM system for basic banking operations.
